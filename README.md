# 3D-testing
Feedback and issues for the in-browser 3D Astro Pi

**Esteemed Testers:** You'll find work-in-progress issues to help keep track of what's coming up.  No need to track specific bugs during early development; just use the WIP issues to discuss.  That's also where we'll post links and updates during early development.  These WIP issues will then convert to or be closed and replaced by Requests for Testing to indicate the features are ready for a closer look. Once Requests for Testing are open for a feature we'll track and resolve any bugs that arise via their own issues.

Thanks for helping!
